**Deployment & Production Considerations for Deep Research Agent**

**MVP Scope (Initial Release):**
- The initial production release (MVP) will focus on the core functionality required for the agent to perform its research and reporting tasks.
- Advanced performance optimizations and features will be deferred to future releases to ensure a focused and stable initial launch.
- **Deferred Features**:
  - Caching of research results
  - Asynchronous processing for API calls
  - Concurrent session management
  - Comprehensive load testing

**Environment Setup:**
- **Development**: Local development with debug logging and mock responses
- **Staging**: Testing environment with real API calls but limited data
- **Production**: Full deployment with monitoring and error tracking

**Dependencies & Installation:**
```
# Core dependencies
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
pyyaml

# Optional dependencies (graceful degradation if missing)
pytest          # for testing
black           # for code formatting
```

**Containerization (Docker):**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional with defaults
RESEARCH_DEPTH=standard
MAX_RESEARCH_SOURCES=10
SESSION_STORAGE_PATH=./data/sessions
REPORT_OUTPUT_PATH=./data/reports
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Monitoring & Logging:**
- **Error Tracking**: Log API failures, configuration issues, file system errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Track research completion times, API response times
- **Usage Analytics**: Session counts, query types, report generation statistics
- **Health Checks**: API connectivity, file system permissions, configuration validity

**Security Considerations:**
- **API Key Protection**: Never log or expose API keys
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **File System Security**: Proper permissions for data directories
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement backoff strategies

**Backup & Recovery:**
- **Session Data**: Regular backups of research sessions
- **Configuration**: Version control for settings and environment configs
- **Report Archives**: Optional long-term storage of generated reports
- **Database Migration**: Preparation for future cloud storage integration

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Caching**: Cache common research patterns and results
- **Async Processing**: Consider async/await for API calls
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large research datasets
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Design for multiple simultaneous users

**Maintenance & Updates:**
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning for releases
- **Database Migrations**: Handle schema changes for session data
- **API Updates**: Adapt to changes in Gemini API
- **Feature Toggles**: Enable/disable features without deployment

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and modules
- **Integration Tests**: Test API interactions and data flows
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Test complete research workflows
- **Load Testing**: Verify performance under concurrent usage

The system MUST be designed for easy deployment, monitoring, and maintenance in production environments while maintaining data integrity and user privacy.
