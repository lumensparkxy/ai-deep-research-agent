#### **2.2 Example Enhanced Flow**
```
User: "Best smartphone for photography"

AI Intent Analysis: 
- Decision type: Purchase decision, technology category
- Key factors likely: Image quality, budget, ease of use
- Context needed: Photography type, skill level, usage patterns
- Urgency: Likely moderate (upgrade decision)

Generated Question 1: "What type of photography interests you most - portraits, landscapes, everyday moments, or something specific?"

User: "Portrait photography of my kids"

AI Analysis Update:
- Photography type: Family/portrait (indoor/outdoor mix likely)
- Key factors: Low-light performance, ease of use, quick capture
- Emotional context: Family memories (high importance)
- Technical needs: Auto-focus speed, portrait mode quality

Generated Question 2: "How often do you find yourself taking photos indoors or in challenging lighting situations?"

User: "Yes, lots of indoor shots at home"

AI Analysis Update:
- Low-light performance = HIGH PRIORITY
- Convenience features important (parent context)
- Budget likely secondary to quality for family photos

Generated Question 3: "When you're trying to capture a quick moment with your kids, what frustrates you most about your current phone's camera?"

[Conversation continues with increasingly targeted questions...]
```
